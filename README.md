## Description

This is my Reddit clone coding project that began with Ben Awad's epic [14-hour YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8) and evolved with more functionalities over time. It supports text and content (image, video, links) posts and allows users to create, upvote/downvote, and comment on user-generated posts.

## Version

v1.3

v1.2 Add functionality for image, video, and website posts

v1.1 Redesign with responsive layouts

v1.0 Basic site
